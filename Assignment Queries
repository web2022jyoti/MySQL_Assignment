-- 1)  Create two tables: EmployeeDetails and EmployeeSalary. Columns for EmployeeDetails: EmpId FullName ManagerId DateOfJoining City && Columns for EmployeeSalary: : EmpId Project Salary Variable.

-- Create the EmployeeDetails table
CREATE TABLE EmployeeDetails (
    EmpId INT PRIMARY KEY,
    FullName VARCHAR(255),
    ManagerId INT,
    DateOfJoining DATE,
    City VARCHAR(50)
);

-- Create the EmployeeSalary table
CREATE TABLE EmployeeSalary (
    EmpId INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Project VARCHAR(255),
    Salary DECIMAL(10,2),
    Variable DECIMAL(10,2)
);

-- Insert data into EmployeeDetails table
INSERT INTO EmployeeDetails (EmpId, FullName, ManagerId, DateOfJoining, City)
VALUES
    (1, 'John Smith', 2, '2020-01-15', 'New York'),
    (2, 'Jane Doe', 1, '2021-03-10', 'Boston'),
    (3, 'David Lee', 2, '2019-09-05', 'Chicago'),
    (4, 'Emily Wong', 1, '2020-07-22', 'Seattle');

-- Insert data into EmployeeSalary table
INSERT INTO EmployeeSalary (EmpId, Project, Salary, Variable)
VALUES
    (1, 'Project A', 5000, 1000),
    (3, 'Project C', 4500, 900),
    (4, 'Project D', 5500, 1100);

-- 2) SQL Query to fetch records that are present in one table but not in another table.


SELECT ed.*
FROM EmployeeDetails ed
LEFT JOIN EmployeeSalary es ON ed.EmpId = es.EmpId
WHERE es.EmpId IS NULL;




-- 3) SQL query to fetch all the employees who are not working on any project.

SELECT ed.*
FROM EmployeeDetails ed
LEFT JOIN EmployeeSalary es ON ed.EmpId = es.EmpId
WHERE es.Project IS NULL;



-- 4) SQL query to fetch all the Employees from EmployeeDetails who joined in the Year 2020.

SELECT *
FROM EmployeeDetails
WHERE DateOfJoining >= '2020-01-01' AND DateOfJoining < '2021-01-01';




-- 5) Fetch all employees from EmployeeDetails who have a salary record in EmployeeSalary.

SELECT ed.*
FROM EmployeeDetails ed
INNER JOIN EmployeeSalary es ON ed.EmpId = es.EmpId;



-- 6) Write an SQL query to fetch a project-wise count of employees.

SELECT Project, COUNT(EmpId) AS EmployeeCount
FROM EmployeeSalary
GROUP BY Project;



-- 7) Fetch employee names and salaries even if the salary value is not present for the employee.

SELECT ed.FullName, COALESCE(es.Salary, 'N/A') AS Salary
FROM EmployeeDetails ed
LEFT JOIN EmployeeSalary es ON ed.EmpId = es.EmpId;



-- 8) Write an SQL query to fetch all the Employees who are also managers.

SELECT e.*
FROM EmployeeDetails e
INNER JOIN EmployeeDetails m ON e.EmpId = m.ManagerId;



-- 9) Write an SQL query to fetch duplicate records from EmployeeDetails.

SELECT EmpId, FullName, ManagerId, DateOfJoining, City, COUNT(*) AS DuplicateCount
FROM EmployeeDetails
GROUP BY EmpId, FullName, ManagerId, DateOfJoining, City
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;



-- 10) Write an SQL query to fetch only odd rows from the table.

SELECT *
FROM (
  SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY (SELECT NULL)) AS RowNum
  FROM EmployeeDetails
) AS T
WHERE T.RowNum % 2 = 1;




-- 11) Write a query to find the 3rd highest salary from a table without top or limit keyword.

SELECT Salary
FROM EmployeeSalary
WHERE Salary < (
    SELECT MAX(Salary)
    FROM EmployeeSalary
    WHERE Salary < (
        SELECT MAX(Salary)
        FROM EmployeeSalary
    )
)
ORDER BY Salary DESC
LIMIT 1;
